#Addition operator (+)
#Example-1
a <- c (1, 0.1) 
b <- c (2.33, 4) 
print (a+b) 

#Multiplication Operator (*) 
#The multiplication of corresponding elements of vectors and Integers are multiplied with the use of the �*� operator.
#Example-1
B= c(4,4) 
C= c(5,5) 
print (B*C) 

#Division Operator (/) 
#The first operand is divided by the second operand with the use of the �/� operator.
#Example-1
a <- 10 
b <- 5 
print (a/b) 

#Modulo Operator (%%)
#The remainder of the first operand divided by the second operand is returned.
list1<- c(2, 22) 
list2<-c(2,4) 
print(list1 %% list2)
